**Directions to run**
- To create a production build on Visual Studio, select Build > Publish Selection
- Select Folder as target and then select a folder to publish to
- Add the unsorted names text file to the folder containing the executable file (default is bin\Release\net8.0)
- To run, open command prompt and run with `name-sorter ./unsorted-names-list.txt`

**Notes**
- As you can probably see, I don't have much experience doing this kind of exercise so apologies if it's not what you wanted! In my previous role my team didn't use unit tests so this is my first time writing them.
- Also apologies - I tried to set up a build pipeline on both Travis and AppVeyor but I wasn't able to do it. Again it's not something I've done before but I would be keen to learn more about them.
- I really enjoyed working on this task and I would love some feedback if that's possible.
